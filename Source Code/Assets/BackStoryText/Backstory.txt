While on a quest to discover the lost city of Lemuria and recover the fabled Ring of Knowledge.
The explorer discovered a mysterious hole in the ground.
Curiously, he leaned over the edge to get a closer look of what was hidden deep within the hole.
Suddenly, the explorer lost his footing and plunged into the void and broke into a free fall.
As the explorer plummeted deeper into the peculiar opening he began to see a faint twinkling blue light that grew bigger and bigger the longer the explorer fell.
Eventually, the explorer had reached the source of the blue light which seemed to be some sort of portal.
Then, everything turned white and the explorer found himself on the ground once again in a dark ice cavern.
Where was he and how could he get out? Was it possible to escape this place?
The explorer picked up a sword that he found on the ground and ventured deeper into the cave.
